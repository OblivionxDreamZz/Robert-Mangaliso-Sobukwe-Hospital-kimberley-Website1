                    <p>Neurology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the nervous system. The
                    nervous system is a complex, sophisticated system that regulates and coordinates body activities. It has two major
                    divisions:
                    
                    Central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord
                    Peripheral nervous system: all other neural elements, such as eyes, ears, skin, and other "sensory receptors"
                    A doctor who specializes in neurology is called a neurologist. The neurologist treats disorders that affect the brain,
                    spinal cord, and nerves, such as:
                    
                    Cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke
                    Demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis
                    Headache disorders
                    Infections of the brain and peripheral nervous system
                    Movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease
                    Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou
                    Gehrig's disease)
                    Seizure disorders, such as epilepsy
                    Spinal cord disorders
                    Speech and language disorders
                    Neurologists do not perform surgery. If one of their patients requires surgery, they refer them to a neurosurgeon.</p>
