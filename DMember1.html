                    <p>Psychiatry is the branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental, emotional and
                    behavioral disorders.
                    
                    A psychiatrist is a medical doctor (an M.D. or D.O.) who specializes in mental health, including substance use
                    disorders. Psychiatrists are qualified to assess both the mental and physical aspects of psychological problems.
                    
                    People seek psychiatric help for many reasons. The problems can be sudden, such as a panic attack, frightening
                    hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, or hearing "voices." Or they may be more long-term, such as feelings of sadness,
                    hopelessness, or anxiousness that never seem to lift or problems functioning, causing everyday life to feel distorted or
                    out of control.</p>

                    <p> Psychiatrists can order or perform a full range of medical laboratory and psychological
                    tests which, combined with discussions with patients, they help provide a picture of a patient's physical and mental state.
                    Their education and clinical training equip them to understand the complex relationship between emotional and other
                    medical illnesses and the relationships with genetics and family history, to evaluate medical and psychological data, to
                    make a diagnosis, and to work with patients to develop treatment plans.</p>
